## Functional
1. Given a long URL, create an associated short URL.  
2. Given a short URL, return the associated long URL. 

## Non-Functional
1. Availability - This service has to be highly available. Especially functionality (2) (redirection).  
2. Response time - Functionality (2) has to have low response time, e.g., less than 10ms. Functionality (1) (creating short URL) can takes more time - less than 10 seconds.  
3. Scalability - We will get more and more requests to create short URLs, so the storage has to be highly scalable.
